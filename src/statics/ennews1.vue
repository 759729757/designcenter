        In the Dean’s Dialogue, Dr. Gao first introduced the development strategy of the Future Design School (in preparation) of Beijing Normal University and gave a new interpretation of the term future. He believes that future and innovation are similar in a sense, and both are indefinable. He hoped that the FDS would be an interdisciplinary, unconfined, and experimenting school.
