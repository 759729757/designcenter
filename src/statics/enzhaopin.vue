        <br>In order to build a "comprehensive, research-oriented and world-class university with Chinese characteristics", Beijing Normal University (BNU) has established the Zhuhai Campus as a significant constitutional part. Sticking to the strategic deployment of “One University, Two Campuses”, Zhuhai Campus will develop with the unified positioning as Beijing Campus, based on the principle of “High standard, New mechanism and Internationalization”. In August, 2017, Guangdong Provincial and Zhuhai Municipal governments, and BNU signed a tripartite agreement in Guangzhou to jointly bolster the development of Zhuhai Campus and in April, 2019, the construction plan of Zhuhai Campus is officially approved by the Ministry of Education.
        <br>
        <br>Beijing Normal University Future Design Center (FDC) is a research-based center established in November 2019 and it carries out the preparation for the establishment of Future Design School (FDS) of Beijing Normal University estimated in early 2021. Grounded at the cross-disciplinary research in art and technology, FDC fosters an integrated practice of research, education and practice through collaboration across humanities, arts, design, technology and social sciences, and provides problem-driven and project-oriented education within complementary disciplines. It covers three research directions: <strong>Future Design, Art and Technology, Design and Education.</strong> FDC aims to equip innovative talents with professional literacy, cutting-edge vision, comprehensive analytical skills, and scientific and humanistic concepts. With the goal of providing pioneering and exploration practices for design industry, FDC also focuses on the design and development of experimental products applied in practical environment with international advanced standards.

        <br><strong>I. Background and Significance</strong>
        <br>With the emergence and application of new technologies, the world is moving towards a new way of life, featuring “diversity, electronics, new languages, new communication modes and experience". However, the research in the field of future design has not received enough attention and support for designers and design studios in China. In order to stimulate the innovation of designers in this field and to build up a global talent pool, the FDC and the FDS (in preparation) officially launched the Future Design Seed Fund on October 15, 2020.
        <br>
        <br>The Seed Fund is a public welfare fund designed to support outstanding designers, design teams and design companies around the world. By providing a platform for designers with the spirit of "future innovation", the exchange, observation, research and self-examination of designers can be facilitated, making them link art with technology with social responsibilities. With the Seed Fund, the FDC and FDS (in preparation) expect to attract and gather the world's outstanding designers to Zhuhai with seed funding and make Zhuhai a gathering place for innovative design talent.
        <br>
        <br>The Seed Fund invites a panel of eight experts from leading art schools in China and abroad, as well as the judges with the world's leading design awards and design disciplines.
        <br>
        <br>Launching the Seed Fund aims to identify design talents and youth teachers worldwide for the talent pool of FDC and FDS (in preparation); to organize a wide range of social forces to jointly carry out scientific research; to build a new type of practical training platform and optimize the training mode for talent innovation; and to deepen university-enterprise cooperation and accelerate the transformation of scientific research results in FDC and FDS (in preparation).
