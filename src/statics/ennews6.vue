        Currently, FDC has completed a preliminary concept plan for Tea Space Design of 2020 Dubai Expo China Pavilion. The center has twice reported to the committee and further polished the design based on the committee's feedback. Themed on “A Leaf of One Thousand Years”, the project adopted a piece of tea leaf to show the world the oriental worldview - “To see the world in a wild flower, and a bodhi in a piece of leaf”. By using contemporary design techniques, a Chinese tea room is well presented with artistic conception. The body part of this tea room is located in an outdoor open space connected to a sky corridor, creating the natural atmosphere of a garden tea room.

        In this September, a real-size Tea Space of the 2020 Dubai Expo China Pavilion will be completed at BNU Zhuhai for the refinement of the design at the Dubai Expo and be open to the public who cannot travel to Expo Dubai. In the future, this space will be continuously open to the students and faculty of Future Design School at BNU Zhuhai for educational purpose. By the end of September, this space will be replicated in 2020 Dubai Expo China Pavilion, spreading the traditional Chinese tea culture.
