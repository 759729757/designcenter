        <br> Born in April 25, 1967, Miriam Mirolla lives and works in Rome. Her general interests are areas of contemporary art, education, avant-garde theories, philanthropy, psychology of art, digital humanities, subliminal perception, gender studies and mythology - subjects on which she has published numerous journal papers, conference papers, books and monographs, as well as she has curated numerous group and solo exhibitions. Current research focuses on experimental teaching and research, interaction theories, applied technologies to art museums and education.
        <br>
        <br>Her university education takes place in Rome at the end of the 1980s, in the scenario of an open dialectic between Primitivism and the Avant-garde. From the beginning, she chooses to deal with the concept of future. In 1986 she joins the Eventualist Theory, founded by the artist and psychologist Sergio Lombardo, at the Experimental Studies Center for the Psychology of Art Jartrakor in Rome. She later became a Member of Scientific Committee in the Journal of Art Psychology. In 1991 she has her degree in "Literature and Philosophy" at La Sapienza University in Rome, Italy. A few months later, she was an internal curator at the P.S.1 Institute for Contemporary Art, New York, where she gained experience in general exhibition organization and interactive education.
        <br>
        <br>From 1995 she will be teaching in several institutions: Academy of Fine Arts in Turin, Venice, Carrara, Macerata, Frosinone, University of Human Sciences and Education in Perugia, Quasar Institute for Advanced Design and Academy of Fine Arts in Rome, where she is a Chair in Theory of Perception and a Chair in Psychology of Art.
        <br>
        <br>Her long and deep experience in Art and Education, since the beginning based on a clear theoretical base, leads her to become both an Academic Professor and an Experimental Artist. She is systematically exploring a pioneering collaboration with the most important institutions in the city of Rome: Capitoline Museums, Council of State, Camillo and Marguerite Caetani Foundation, MAXXI Foundation, MACRO Museum and Auditorium Museum, with the collaboration of her annual students. She is also promoter and chairman of the Ist Congress of Art Psychology, Capitoline Museums in Rome, 2010; founder and scientific director of the Laboratory of Art Psychology (LAP), 2010; founder and president of APExperience Association, 2018; chairman of the II Congress of Art Psychology, Asylum MACRO, Rome, 2019.
        <br>
        <br>As an Experimental Artist, she has realized numerous exhibitions and collective experiments, as reported in the book by Melchiorre E., "Miriam Mirolla, Experiments in Art" (2017).  For several decades she has been studying and promoting Italian art and Italian avant-garde theories in the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and China at the Academy of Fine Arts in London (1994; Wimbledon Academy of Fine Arts (1998); State Institute for Art Studies, Moscow (2011); Italian Institute of Culture in Beijing (2017); University of Wuppertal, Germany (2017); Florida Atlantic University, Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Boca Raton Campus, Florida (2017); Rome University La Sapienza (2018).
